**INTERNSHIP:** Intern-Web Development</br>
I did an internship at Tonmetri Info Solutions where my focus was on web development, resulting in valuable hands-on experience. This internship afforded me the opportunity to adeptly apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, contributing to the enhancement of my proficiency in these technologies.</br>

**WORK EXPERIENCE:**
Throughout my 2.5-year tenure at Accenture, I was actively involved in an SAP SuccessFactors project, handling responsibilities in Employee Central, CWM, and GSI. During this period, I successfully forged strategic partnerships with over 13 key clients, leading to a significant improvement in team performance. Additionally, I have completed an intensive six-month Salesforce training program, underscoring my dedication to ongoing learning and professional development. Notably, within 15 months of my entry-level hire, I demonstrated exceptional capabilities while spearheading a major GSI project, overseeing operations in over 10 countries, and achieving outstanding project results. Furthermore, I led the effort to enhance the skill set of three team members through advanced methodologies, leading to significant improvements in both customer understanding and overall team effectiveness.

**CERTIFICATIONS/ WORKSHOPS:**</br>
**Cloud Computing:**
I attended a 2-day workshop on Cloud Computing at KL University, organized by Azure Skynet Solutions (P) Ltd. in collaboration with Composit-IIT Kharagpur. Throughout the workshop, I acquired a comprehensive understanding of Android, covering essentials such as Java, Android Security, and Malware. Additionally, I gained practical experience by working with the Android Studio software.

**Data Science and AI Applications in Automobile:**
I attended a 5-day certificate course on Data Science Applications in Automobiles at KL University. During the course, I gained insights into extracting valuable insights from large datasets.
 
**Machine learning:**
I took an online machine learning course from Stanford University on Coursera. In the course, I learned how to create machine learning models in Python using popular libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn. I also learned to build and train supervised machine learning models for tasks like prediction and binary classification, including linear regression and logistic regression.

**STM32 Embedded Industrial Board:**
I attended a National Level Technical Fest Thrusang organized by Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation. I participated in a hands-on workshop where I gained detailed technical knowledge about the STM32 series. The seminar covered the system architecture and advanced digital and analog features of STM32 devices.

**PROJECTS:**</br>
**Bluetooth-based vehicle collision avoidance system:**
During the final year of my undergraduate engineering program, our team developed a project with the primary objective of designing and deploying an application for Android handsets. This application aimed to alert operators about adjacent movements, thereby promoting driver safety and reducing the risk of accidents between individual cars.
Technology used: IOT, Android studio
